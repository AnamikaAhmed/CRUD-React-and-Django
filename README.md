# CRUD-React-and-Django
The application :
1) Creates a Django restful API
2) Pushes into the API
3) Fetches from the API into a table. The table has option to edit and delete rows, and this directly interacts with the backend API

4) Prints the table 

At first, run the backend API: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/posts/
Then run the frontend: http://localhost:3000
